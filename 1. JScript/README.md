# JScript

JScript is a script language made by Microsoft, a dialect of the ECMAScript standard.

Actually JScript is used quite widely, you can see it in Internet Explorer, (ASP).NET Framework or Windows.

## JScript for Windows Script Host

JScript can be used to write scripts for Windows. But there is little information right there about it so ah, I wish I could find more.

## JScript for .NET Framework

You also can use it to make .NET Framework application on Windows just like C# or VB.NET does.

However JScript.NET is almost deprecated. We use C# nowdays.
